## Overview
Lewis House has served as more than just a residence hall; it has been home to a close-knit, private organization centered on camaraderie, shared values, and resilience. Room 810, in particular, holds special significance within Lewis House as a central gathering place for members, embodying the spirit of the organization and serving as a hub for planning, friendship, and tradition.

This community endured significant milestones, including the COVID-19 era, which strengthened the bonds among its members and solidified Lewis House’s reputation as a safe haven for students seeking connection in uncertain times. 

Originally slated for demolition by 2024 ([August 2022 announcement](https://vanderbilthustler.com/2022/08/16/highland-quad-to-be-demolished-by-2024/)), Lewis House’s final closure has since been deferred to the 2024-2025 academic year ([August 2023 update](https://news.vanderbilt.edu/2023/08/16/existing-residence-halls-to-remain-in-highland-quad-through-2024-25/)). Additionally, Vanderbilt University may now [explore alternative uses for the Highland Quad area](https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/08/17/highland-quad-demolition-paused-university-to-explore-other-uses-for-area/), leaving the ultimate fate of this historic location uncertain. 

Even as the physical structure faces demolition, the legacy of Lewis House lives on through its organization, ensuring that its spirit and impact endure in the memories of those who called it home.
